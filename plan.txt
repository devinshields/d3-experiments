ML Web Service:
    *** do something I think is cool, won't finish unfun projects ***
    TODO:
        pick a publicly available, static data-set + an input parameter and a drill down parameter
        pick an ML behavior - LDA, clustering, classification, whatever
        pick an algorithm (NB, NLP, etc.) likely to work on any inputs. Limit inputs to 'should work' sets
    REQUIREMENTS;
        use a simple, pre-build html template
    reference multiple data sources? database + server side curl?
    make the results personal - user's input URL, tweets, FB account, whatever
    show a pretty picture, D3.js
      Geospatial is always fun

IDEAS:
    x) Stock Clustering & Automatic Company-Group Summarization (LDA)
          i.   cluster the input tickers by correlation
          ii.  fetch ticker articles 
          iii. results will be grouped into sectors
          iv.  LDA results will summarize the meaning of each group

    x)
